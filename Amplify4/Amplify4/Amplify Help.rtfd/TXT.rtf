\i \cf0 Amplify
\i0  is a Mac program for simulating DNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. You supply the DNA sequences of one or more primers plus a length of target DNA sequence, and 
\i Amplify
\i0  will generate a map of the expected outcome. It will also provide other helpful information such as the sequences of likely amplified fragments, warnings about potential primer dimers, etc.\
\

\i Amplify
\i0  is useful for planning experiments and for teaching students about PCR.\

\f2\b\fs36  Step 1: Open text files with the target and primer sequences\
\pard\tx6480\pardeftab720\li576\ri-19445

\b0\fs28 \cf0 \
You need to tell 
\i Amplify
\i0  the DNA sequences of the target area plus those of one or more primers. Primers are short fragments of synthesized DNA, typically around 20 bp. The target is usually a stretch of sequence from the genome of an organism whose DNA you want to amplify. \
\
If you want to test 
\i Amplify
\i0  but don't have any target or primer sequences handy, just select 
\b Open Built-In Samples
\b0  from the 
\b File
\b0  menu.\
\
Go to the 
\b File
\i  
\i0\b0 menu and select 
\b Open
\b0  (
\f1 \uc0\u8984 
\f2 -O) to open your text files containing the target and/or the primer sequences. These can simple text files with the extension \'93.txt\'94 or more specific files like \'93.rtf\'94, \'93.csv\'94, \'93.primers\'94, \'93.pri\'94 and others. See below for more details about file formats.\
\
When you select a text file to open, 
\i Amplify
\i0  will know whether it contains the target sequence or a list of primers. (How does it know? It can usually tell by the file extension. If not, it checks to see whether the file \'93looks\'94 like a list of primers which typically has multiple lines with one or more tab characters per line.) When you open the target sequence, 
\i Amplify
\i0  will display it on the left side of the screen. The list of primers will go on the right.\
\
\pard\tx6480\pardeftab720\li270\ri-19445

\f4 \cf2 \'95
\f2\b\fs36  Step 2: Select one or more primers from the list\
\pard\tx6480\pardeftab720\li576\ri-19445

\b0\fs28 \cf0 \
To the left of each primer sequence you will see a checkbox. You must check at least one to run a PCR, but you can check as many as you like. \
\
One way to mark a set of primers is to start by selecting them using the 
\f1 \uc0\u8984 
\f2 -click, then choose 
\b Check
\b0  from the popup menu, 
\b Selected
\b0 , above the primer list.\

\f2\b\fs36  Step 3: Run the PCR simulation\
\pard\tx6480\pardeftab720\li576\ri-19445

\b0\fs28 \cf0 \
When you choose 
\b Amplify
\b0  from the 
\b PCR
\b0  menu (
\f1 \uc0\u8984 
\f2 -1), 
\i Amplify
\i0  will draw a map of the expected outcome. You can now click on items in this drawing to get more information about each.\
\
You can also save or print the results. The results consist of the map in the top half of the window and the textual output in the bottom half. You save and print these two halves separately.\
\

\f2  The 
\i Amplify
\i0  Windows\
\pard\tx6480\pardeftab720\li576\ri-19445

\fs28 \cf0 \cb1 \
There are two kinds of windows in 
\i Amplify
\i0 . One, the substrate window, contains the information you supply: the target sequence and the primers. The other, the PCR results window, contains the results of 
\i Amplify
\i0 's simulated PCR.\
\
The substrate window is the one that shows up when you first open the program. It consists of a left and right portion with a "split window" vertical bar between them. You can move this vertical bar left and right to alter the relative size of the two parts. You can also resize the whole window. The left side contains the target sequence and the right side has the primer list.\
\
When you run a simulated PCR (
\f1 \uc0\u8984 
\f2 -1) a new PCR window will be generated. It also consists of two parts -- an upper part with the amplification map and a lower part with textual output. There is a moveable separator bar between them. The map is described in more detail below. The textual output contains information you request by clicking on elements of the map. \

\fs28 \cf0 \cb1 \
The target sequence for amplification appears as editable text in the left half of the substrate window. You can add a sequence to by copying and pasting, or else by opening a text file.\

\b0\fs28 \cf0 Some sequence files come with a preamble or header before the actual sequence begins. 
\i Amplify
\i0  assumes that there is a specific string that separates the header from the rest of the sequence. You can set this header string to be whatever you like in the "Preferences" dialog. For example, a delimiter string might be "End Header" or "..". Having a sequence header is optional.\

\i\b0\fs28 \cf0 Amplify
\i0  allows you to mark specified parts of your target by changing the color or setting the text as boldface or italicization. This feature is handy for marking areas of interest. These styles have no effect on the amplification. You are also free to use upper or lower case letters. \
\
You should use only color and text style to mark bases, however. The font and size should be uniform throughout the target sequence in order for the base count numbers to the left of the sequence to be accurate. You can, however, select a different font and size for the 
\i entire
\i0  target sequence. Do this with the popup menus above the target sequence. Note that only monospaced fonts should be used.\

\b0\fs28 \cf0 The actual sequence part of the text (i.e., the text following any sequence header) must consist of the letters A, T, C, G or N (or a, t, c, g or n).

The list of your available primers appears on the right side of the substrate window. It has columns for the primer's sequence, its name and any other "notes" you might want to include. \
\
Your primers can be stored in a tab-delimited text file and opened within

\i0  with the 
\b Open
\b0  selection (

\
The \ul primer\ulnone  names should be short, usually no more than 10 characters, so that they don't overlap when displayed on the map. \
\
The \ul notes\ulnone  column can have whatever textual information you want. This column isn't used in the PCR simulation, but you can use it for searching, selecting and organizing your primer list.\

\b0\fs28 \cf0 You can make your primer list right within 
\i Amplify
\i0 , but it's probably easier to use another program, such as a spreadsheet or text editor. You can even use a word processor, provided you use the option to save as plain text. Regardless of what software you use, the end result should be a plain text file where each primer is on a separate line, and the columns are separated by tabs. Alternatively, it can be a "csv" or "comma-separated value" file where the columns are delimited by commas and the file extension is .csv. \
\
The order of the columns should be the same as in the primer list. That is: Sequence - Name - Notes. If you have a primer list with a different order, it is easy to change it within a spreadsheet program when columns can be dragged to any desired order.\
\

\i Amplify4

In the example shown above, the primer named "BCD" is selected whereas two others, "bif16" and "BPg" are checked. The difference is that those with a check-mark will be used in the PCR simulation whereas the selected primers are the ones affected by copying, editing, etc.\
\
You can select multiple primers by dragging over them, or by holding down the 
\f1 \uc0\u8984 
\f2  key while clicking the primer rows. The selected primers do not have to be contiguous in the list.\

Copying and pasting primers works as you would expect it to. When you choose 
\b Copy
\b0  (
\f1 \uc0\u8984 
\f2 -C) all the selected primers are placed on the clipboard, even if the selected primers are not contiguous in the list. The 
\b Cut
\b0  command (
\f1 \uc0\u8984 
\f2 -X) is the same except that the selected primers are also removed from the list.\
\
Once you have copied a set of primers onto the clipboard, you can 
\b Paste 
\b0 them (
\f1 \uc0\u8984 
\f2 -V) into a spreadsheet program, a text editor or to another position in your 
\i Amplify
\i0  primer list. If you 
\b Paste
\b0  them into the primer list, they will go above the first selected primer.\
\
You can also copy primers from a text editor or spreadsheet program and paste them into 
\i Amplify
\i0 . Pasting works the same way.\
\

\i Hint:
\i0  Here is a way to collect a group of primers from anywhere in your list and move them to a single location. First select them all using

\b0\fs28 \cf0 Some primers have the potential to pair up in such a way that they can use each other as templates for DNA synthesis. This process prevents the primers from functioning properly in your reaction. Worse yet, the resulting small fragments can form a particularly nasty kind of contaminant in your lab, poisoning future reactions that use either of these two primers.\

\cf0 There is no perfect method that I know of for predicting exactly what will amplify and how well. The results of your PCR depend too sensitively on too many variables. However, after a lot of trial-and-error, I came up with an approach that has worked well in my lab. We started using this method more than 20 years ago, and have performed about a million reactions based on these predictions. So the methods have been well tested for the specific techniques we use. I have also received a great deal of feedback from 
\i Amplify
\i0  users indicating that the predictions have worked well for them too. However, that doesn't guarantee that the standard methods in

\fs28 \cf0 The method used by 
\i Amplify
\i0  is two dimensional. It computes two distinct attributes for each potential primer match, and displays the match only if each criterion exceed its pre-set threshold. If they do, the match is included, and the size of the arrow drawn on the map reflects the sum of the two quantities.\
\
The two quantities are called "primability" and "stability." The difference is that the former gives most of the weight to base matches near the 3\uc0\u8242  end, thus enabling the match to behave as a good PCR primer. The second weights each base match according to the length of run it is in. Thus, this quantity reflects the overall stability of the primer-target bond.\
\
Both quantities make use of a table of pair scores to assign a numerical value to each potential base pairing. The default values for these scores are shown below, but they can be changed in the settings.\

\b0\fs28 \cf0 Here is where you can modify all the parameters used to evaluate primer matches. \
\
The "Maximum Effective Primer" is a safety feature in case you use very long primers. The default value of 30 means that if a primer is more than 30 bp, only the 30 bases from the 3\uc0\u8242  end will be used to evaluate the 
\i primability
\i0  and 
\i stability
\i0  of the match. However, the entire primer will be included in the amplicon.\
\
The "Primability Cutoff" and "Stability Cutoff" are used to determine which matches are shown on the PCR map. A match must satisfy both conditions.\
\
The "Base Pair Scores", "Match Weights" and "Run Weights" are described above in along with the algorithms.\

\b0 Try making the window narrower. 
\i Amplify
\i0  prints the map and textual output in a way that each line on the page matches what you see on the screen. So by making the window narrower, you tell 
\i Amplify
\i0  that it does not have to scale the text or image down as much to fit.

\fs32 \cf0 A:

\b0 It\'92s all pretty much trial-and-error. I tested a variety of algorithmic approaches, and found that the two-dimensional approach with separate quantities for 
\i primability 
\i0 and 
\i stability 
\i0 worked for all the PCR runs in my lab. Once I found a workable method, it produced reliable results through many years, several postdocs and a variety of protocols used in my lab. If you find that 
\i Amplify\'92s
\i0  predictions don\'92t match your results, you can tinker with the parameters in the settings window. When you find a combination that works for you, you can save it as your defaults. (Don\'92t worry, you can always restore the original settings.) You can also share your settings with others by saving them in a file. All these options are in the 
\b Preferences\'85
\b0  window.\

\

\b0 Version 4 was completely re-written in a language that should be more easily maintained as the MacOS evolves. Version 4 is in the 
\i Swift
\i0  programming language, which is much more widely used than the other languages I have used for previous versions of 
\i Amplify
\i0 . \
\
Here are a few changes you might notice:\
\
\'96 Split screens are now used to keep the two kinds of substrate -- target and primers -- together in one window, and the two kinds of results -- graphic map and textual output -- in another.\
\
\'96 Amplify will automatically reopen your last-used primer and target files. (You can turn this feature off.) An \'93Open Recent\'94 menu item is also included.\
\
\'96 Length limitations on the target sequence and primers have been removed.\
\
\'96 Parallel processing is now employed for better performance on multi-core computers.\
\
\'96 Opening target and primer files is simplified so that both kinds of file can be opened at once from the same dialog. (
\i Amplify
\i0  can tell whether a file contains primers or a target.)\
\
\'96 Cutting and pasting primers and primer lists is more robust. You can use the clipboard to move primers around within 
\i Amplify\'92s
\i0  primer list, or to and from spreadsheet programs.\
\
\'96 Styled text is used in the output to make the results more readable. You can also save this styled text in \'93rich text format\'94.\
\
\'96 The online help has been expanded and combined. It also has a 
\b Topics
\b0  popup menu and another for 
\b Frequently Asked Questions.
