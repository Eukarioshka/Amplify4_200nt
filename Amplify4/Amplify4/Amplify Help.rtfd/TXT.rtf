\cf0 Matches are evaluated according to two parameters called "primability" and "stability." They both measure how well the primer matches the target site, but the former emphasizes matches at the 3' end, and the latter places more weight on runs of consecutive matches. You can adjust how these parameters are calculated by changing the settings. Here is what the values {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.macworld.com"}}{\fldrslt mean}}:\

\f1\b\fs44 Primer Dimers\
\pard\tx6480\pardeftab720\li576\ri-19445

\b0\fs28 \cf0 \
Some primers have the potential to pair up in such a way that they can use each other as templates for DNA synthesis. For example, two primers might line up this way:\
\
\pard\tx6480\pardeftab720\li576\ri-19445

\f2 \cf0 5' GTCGGCTACTCCTTGCGTCG 3'  \
                  |||||\
               3' GCAGCCCTGGTGGAATACAA 5'  
\f1 \
\
This process prevents the primers from functioning properly in your reaction. Worse yet, the resulting small fragments can form a particularly nasty kind of contaminant in your lab, poisoning future reactions that use either of these two primers.\

\i0  flags potential primer-dimer combinations if (1) the region of overlap is at least as large as the number specified, and (2) the "quality" of the match within the overlap is greater than a cutoff value set by the Stringency slider on this panel.\
\
The "quality" is the sum of the numbers for in the shown matrix for each base pair. You can set the numbers to be whatever you like. The defaults were computed as A + wG \'96 M, where A is the probability of an A-T pair, G is the probability of a G-C pair, and M is the probability of a mismatch. The weighting factor, w, gives extra weight to G-C pairs. I used w = 1.5 in arriving at the default values.\

These criteria seem to work well in practice in identifying potential dimer-forming pairs, but they are not based on any theory. Feel free to try other values, and please let me know if you find a set that works better than the defaults.\

Placing your cursor over a match causes that match to be highlighted along with any amplicons for which that match was used. In addition, a line of text near the top of the map gives the full name of the primer and the position within the target sequence. \
\
When your cursor lies over an amplicon, that amplicon's line is highlighted along with the corresponding two primer matches. There is also a line of text near the top of the map indicating the names of the primers and the sizes of the amplicon's components. For "linear" fragments, the components consist of the left primer, the synthesized DNA and the right primer. The "circular" amplicons are indicated by arrowheads at the left and right ends of the line (to suggest continuation) as well as an interruption in the line. For those amplicons, the components are the rightward primer, the synthesized portion on the right end of the map, the synthesized portion on the left side of the map, and the leftward primer.\

When a match or amplicon is highlighted, you can click to obtain more detailed information. In addition, the portion of the target sequence corresponding to the match is selected. (You must open the Target Sequence window in order to see this selection.)\
\
For matches, 
\i Amplify
\i0  shows you a diagram of how the primer and target sequence line up. For example:\

We see that the primer matches the target sequence in the leftward direction between target positions 1719 and 1737. Furthermore, we can see that there are only two outright mismatches and one ambiguous match. All other sites match, as indicated by a vertical line.\
\
All sequence are drawn 5' to 3' unless otherwise indicated. Rightward matches are drawn like this:\
\
\pard\tx6480\pardeftab720\li576\ri-19445

\f2 \cf0                  2108                 2127\

Note that since both the target and primer are shown 5' to 3', a match is actually a pair of identical rather than complementary bases. Drawing the two kinds of matches differently is done so that (a) the target sequence can always be shown 5' to 3', and (b) the primers can always be shown with their actual bases.\

When an amplicon is highlighted, you can click on it to see more detailed information about it. The "quality" of the amplicon is its length multiplied by the square of the product of the two match qualities. This is the measure used to arrange the amplicons in order on the map.\
\
Also shown is the sequence of the amplicon. Note that this sequence is not necessarily the same as the corresponding segment of the target sequence, because the two primers might not match perfectly.\
\
Finally, if you open the target sequence window after clicking on an amplicon, you will find the relevant portion of the sequence selected.\

\b0\fs28 \cf0 \
Use the magnifying glass icon to expand the map around a particular point. The sizes of the match arrows will not increase, however. This feature allows you to distinguish between two matches that happen to lie very close together.\
\
You can also use the magnifying glass icon to reduce the size of the map by holding down the option key.\
\
Change the position of the map on your screen with the scroll bar and the grabber icon.\
\
The "Standard View" button restores the map to its normal size and position.\

\pard\tx6480\pardeftab720\li576\ri-19445

\b0\fs28 \cf0 \
When you select "Save As ..." you create a file with a vector graphics version of your amplification map. The resulting file can be opened by most graphics software that support vector graphics. However, some programs do not recognize rotated text. In that case, the vertical primer names will not be visible.\
\
You can print a copy of the map to most printers. \
